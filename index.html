                <h2>The History of Boba Tea</h2>
                <p>
                    Boba tea was first created in the 1980s in Taiwan. The original version was a simple milk tea served
                    with chewy tapioca pearls,
                    which added a fun and unique texture.

                <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that boba tea is also known as pearl milk tea or bubble tea? The name "bubble tea"
                    comes from the frothy bubbles
                    that form when the tea is shaken, not from the tapioca pearls.
